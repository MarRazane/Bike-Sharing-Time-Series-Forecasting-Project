# Bike-Sharing-Time-Series-Forecasting-Project

# Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting for a bike-sharing dataset. The goal is to build and evaluate predictive models to forecast the demand for bike rentals. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, modeling using SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous factors), and forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). It includes hourly and daily counts of bike rentals, weather information, and other relevant features.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  git clone [https://github.com/MarRazane/Bike-Sharing-Time-Series-Forecasting-Project.git]
